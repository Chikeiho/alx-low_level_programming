This file conatins details of the task to be done on C - variables, if, else, while and they are listed below.

Task 0 - This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.

Task 1 - This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.

Task 2 - Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

	You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
	All your code should be in the main function

	All your code should be in the main function
	You can only use putchar three times in your code

Task 4 - Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

	Print all the letters except q and e
	You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
	All your code should be in the main function
	You can only use putchar twice in your code
Task 5 - Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

	All your code should be in the main function

Task 6 - Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

	You are not allowed to use any variable of type char
	You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
	You can only use putchar twice in your code
	All your code should be in the main function

Task 7 - Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.

	You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
	All your code should be in the main function
	You can only use putchar twice in your code

Task 8 - Write a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.

	You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)

Task 9 - Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.

	Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
	Numbers should be printed in ascending order
	You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
	All your code should be in the main function
	You can only use putchar four times maximum in your code
	You are not allowed to use any variable of type char

Task 10 - Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

	Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
	The two digits must be different
	01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1
	Print only the smallest combination of two digits

	All your code should be in the main function

Task 11 - Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits.

	Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
	The three digits must be different
	012, 120, 102, 021, 201, 210 are considered the same combination of the three digits 0, 1 and 2
	Print only the smallest combination of three digits
	Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with three digits
	You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
	You can only use putchar six times maximum in your code
	You are not allowed to use any variable of type char
	All your code should be in the main function

Task 12 - Write a program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.
